# Java Linter
## Description
This is a java project that utilized ObjectWebs java bytecode manipulation library, ASM, to detect design patterns, “code smells”, and general code issues referenced from Google’s style guide. Throughout this project I learned
- How to wrap an extrenal library in order to both make it work exactly how your program intends it to, but also to make it flexible
- How to program correctly and clean for other programmers, or even for future modificaiton that you would do yourself.
- Design patterns and how useful they can be when it comes to programming a flexible system

One of my favorite things that I did in this project was program a class that could take packaages as input and import every class in said package instead of the previous functionality which only took one class.

## How to Use
This is a very simple project so all you have to do is
1. Clone the project from the repo
2. Import it into a Java-Friendly IDE
3. Run as a Java Project

When you run the program a GUI should come up and you
1. Select GUI or Console
2. Select the class or package you want to test
3. Select what checks you would like 
4. Run the program
